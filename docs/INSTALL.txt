IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a module for phpWebSite.  You have to install
phpWebSite >= 0.9.3-4 first as the module will not work with earlier
versions of phpWebSite.  If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first
get the code here:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included
in the docs directory of that download.


Once this is done then you can start installing Mailing Lists:

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE!  Don't send us hate mail if this module crashes
   your website.  (However, we do ask that you tell us about it.)

2. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.  (There is also a .zip
   file for Windows users.)

3. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf module-mailinglists-*.tar.gz

4. Move the new directory into your phpWebSite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpWebSite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you
    would run:

    mv mailinglists /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/mailinglists

5. Go to your web site and install/update Mailing Lists from Boost.

   You are golden.  Mailing Lists is now installed.


If you are having trouble with these procedures please file a Support
Request at our sourceforge.net project site:

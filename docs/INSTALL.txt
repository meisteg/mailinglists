===== IMPORTANT =====

This module is for phpWebSite 1.5.2 or higher.  You have to install
phpWebSite >= 1.5.2 first - earlier versions of phpWebSite will not work.

If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first get the latest code here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL file included in
the docs directory of that download. Once this is done then you can start
installing Mailing Lists.


===== INSTALLATION =====

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  Never install this or any other module without
   doing this.

2. Download the .tar.gz or .zip file from sourceforge and unpack it.

3. Move the new directory into your phpwebsite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

    mv mailinglists /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/mailinglists

4. Go to your phpWS website and install or upgrade "Mailing Lists" from the
   Boost module.

5. (Optional, but recommended) In your site's config.php file, set the
   ALLOW_TABLE_LOCKS define to true.  Table locks are used to protect this
   module's email queue.  Obviously, don't set to true if your database user
   does not have permissions to lock tables.

6. Log out and log back in to your site to reset your environment before
   using the module.

   The module is now installed.  You can access it by going to "Control Panel"
   and clicking on "Administration".

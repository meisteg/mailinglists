      subscribers so no duplicate users will be added.

*mailinglists-0.3.1 (12 Sep 2003)

                   Ivan Havlicek for discovering this issue.

                   supposed to if a certain condition was met.
    - faq.txt added.
    - If a subscription hasn't been activated, no longer send that user an email when they
      unsubscribe.  This will prevent two emails from being sent to the wrong email address.

    - Archives now stores who sent each email.
    - Listing of the Mailing lists now displays date created, last sent info, list ID and status.
      No longer displays the description.  (Admins probably already know what the list is about.)
